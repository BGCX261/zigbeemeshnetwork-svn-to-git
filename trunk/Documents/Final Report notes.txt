1 Introduction:

2 Safety:

3 Research + Design:
- High level design / block diagram

(choices of...)
- Hardware platforms
	- Software (C/asm)
- wireless transmitters
- human interface
	- Control sticks, terminal
- cars/vehicle
	- what is required of the cars? not much
	- turn vs skid vs servo

4 Implementation:
- Car drive system
	- motor turn duration
- Controller
	- analog vs digital control stick
- Wireless system
	- xbee breakout board

5 Testing + implementation:
- car drive system
	- interactive C program to cycle through commands
		- resides on dif handyboard, communicates via crossover
		cable
- controller
- wireless system
	- injecting packets directly from a terminal
- end to end testing
	- control vehicle with the hardware interface (joysticks) through the network
		- ...using crossover cable
